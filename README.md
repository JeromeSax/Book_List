I had issues understanding JSON stringify. I believe we have used this before in class but I didn't understand it.
w3schools was a big help. Even though I don't fully understand the concept I know where to find the answer/study material.

The first part of the code along confused me a bit when I started adding links from bootswatch and fontsawesome. The first link worked but for the fonts link he was using  I messed up. He was using a older version from the looks of it and went to the web page I couldn't just copy the link like he did and had to google CSS link for fontsawesome but it still didn't work. I kept getting errors messages about MIME type. My classmate Omari suggested typing out the link just like it appeared in the youtube video and that solved the problem.

I had small trouble shooting errors along the way. Most of them were just spelling errors in my functions. I'm getting more comfortaable looking at my console/dev tools and reading the errors.
